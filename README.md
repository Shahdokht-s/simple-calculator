"A very simple calculator made by a beginner."
In this personal project, I tried to make my first JavaScript project and made a calculator. 

V1:
In this version, I worked on the visuals, though it's not responsive yet. 
The buttons work, and simple calculations are being done using this calculator. 

I will come back as I learn more and update this calculator further.
Thank you and good bye!
